    <h2>Sausage and Cabbage</h2>
    <p>It’s the right fall dish for any night of the week. Why? It just is, trust me! (And try it.) 
        It’s a great way to work in a new vegetable that you might not normally eat (ahem, cabbage). 
        Sausage is so easy to find at the grocery store and it’s already cooked so it warms up in your skillet with the cabbage that much faster. 
        You can make this dish as spicy or mild as you want, depending on what kind of sausage you purchase and what kind of seasoning you use. (I used Cajun, see the note below for more info!)
        You can eat a lot of it and not feel too guilty! 
        This dish is great for those doing the low-carb thing. 
        It makes great leftovers and reheats easily! 
        This recipe requires only five ingredients (and that includes salt and pepper!)
        It goes great over plain or brown rice if you want to add a little something extra (and quick) to the dish. 
        My whole family will eat it! (That should be the number one reason, really!)</p>

        <p>I think ten reasons are a great start, don’t you? With easy-to-find ingredients
        and only 20 tiny minutes of cooking time, you can cook a homemade dish for yourself 
        or your family or even dinner guests in no time flat. Plus, this dish is a great one
         for putting in a bowl and sitting on the couch or next to a nice fire with a blanket
          on those chilly fall and winter nights. </p>
